## Inspiration

We saw the sports theme and talked about animating a sports game. The idea was then brought up (after one of us saw cards or something) to make it an interactive(ish) game with betting, and then NET BET was born!

## What it does

It's a mini sports betting game that takes past games, let's you place bets (essentially just points) on a variety of topics and then animates the game out.

## How we built it

An excessive amount of pain, a lot of web scraping of https://plaintextsports.com/, a good amount of looking at docs, and, of course, VS Code for python.

## Challenges we ran into

The website that we decided to web-scrape is written to almost intentionally be hard to web scrape which makes no sense given it's a plain text web site. So the web scraping took forever to work out

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

## What we learned

## What's next for Net Bet!

Making this work for every sport and making it work on past seasons and possibly future seasons
